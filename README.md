# F1 Enthusiast
I've been a Formula 1 fan since 2021, and I created this project for my Web Technologies course in the fourth semester. 
The concept behind the project was to cater to the newly growing Formula 1 fanbase in India.

Regarding copyright:
I've used official Formula 1 website links and some F1 pictures from various websites.
